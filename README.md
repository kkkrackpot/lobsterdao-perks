# LobsterDAO Perks
A list of gifts, bonuses, airdrops, 
and other perks, that the members of Lobster 
DAO and the DAO itself have received from 
various projects and individuals.

The list is always WIP, the maintainers 
encourage the readers, and especially the mentioned 
projects, to provide their feedback in the _Issues_.

<details><summary> Notes </summary>
<p>LobsterDAO members are ETH mainnet addresses 
which hold <b>10b57e6</b> NFT(s), either minted, 
or bought on the secondary market (see https://holders.lobsterdao.io/).</p>
<p>A <b>Lobster holder/address</b> is an ETH address which holds <b>10b57e6</b> NFT(s).</p>
<p>The list doesn't specify <i>why</i> a perk was 
given. However, the corresponding projects are 
encouraged to provide such info.</p>
<p>The DAO (its treasury's multisig contract) 
is technically an NFT holder, so it too can be 
eligible for perks, technically.</p>
