# LobsterDAO Perks
A list of gifts, bonuses, airdrops, 
and other perks, that the members of Lobster 
DAO and the DAO itself have received from 
various projects and individuals.

The list is always WIP, the maintainers 
encourage the readers, and especially the mentioned 
projects, to provide their feedback in the [_Issues_](https://github.com/kkkrackpot/lobsterdao-perks/issues). 

- [About LobsterDAO](https://lobsterdao.io)
- [List of the DAO members](https://holders.lobsterdao.io/)

<details><summary> Misc notes to the list</summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LobsterDAO members</b> are <b>Lobster holders</b>, ETH addresses 
which hold <b>10b57e6</b> NFT(s), either minted, 
or bought at secondary markets (see https://holders.lobsterdao.io/).</p>
<p><b>Entry Closed</b>: the entry is not possible 
anymore (e.g. snapshot already taken). The latecomers 
are NGMI even if they get a Lobster NFT now.</p>
<p><b>Entry Open</b>: the entry is still 
possible. However, before aping double check it 
in Lobster Telegram/Discord chat or contact the 
corresponding project directly!</p>
<p>The list doesn't specify <i>why</i> a perk was 
given. However, if a project submits such info here, 
it will be included.</p>
<p>The DAO itself (its treasury's multisig contract) 
is technically an NFT holder, so it too can be 
eligible for perks.</p>
